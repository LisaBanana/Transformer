# Transfomer
This is a PyTorch implementation of the Transformer model in "[Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)" (Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser, Illia Polosukhin, arxiv, 2017). This model is based soley on attention mechanisms and introduces Multi-Head Attention. The encoder and decoder are made of multiple layers, with each layer consisting of Multi-Head Attention and Positionwise Feedforward sublayers. This model is currently used in many state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence and transfer learning tasks.
